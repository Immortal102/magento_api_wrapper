# MagentoApiWrapper

Magento API Wrapper allows you to make calls to Magento's SOAP API. You
can download orders from a store, invoice orders, and update orders as
shipped.

You must first configure your Magento installation properly, creating a
user who has access to the SOAP API. Follow the wiki on how to create
this user here.

## To install: 

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'magento_api_wrapper'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install magento_api_wrapper
