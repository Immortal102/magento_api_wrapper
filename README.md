# MagentoApiWrapper

Magento API Wrapper allows you to make calls to Magento's SOAP API. You
can download orders from a store, invoice orders, and update orders as
shipped.

You must first configure your Magento installation properly, creating a
user who has access to the SOAP API. Follow the wiki on how to create
this user here.

## To install: 

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'magento_api_wrapper'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install magento_api_wrapper

## Usage


##Notes on filters


MagentoApiWrapper allows for two types of filters, <b>simple filters</b>
and <b>complex filters</b>. 


###Simple Filters
Simple filters have a key and a value. The key is part of the Magento
object your retrieving, the value is the specific value you want
returned to you. For example, if you want a Magento store's sales orders
with a status of "complete", you will pass:

```ruby
api.order_list(simple_filters: [{key: "status" value: "complete"}])
```


NOTE: If you want multiple statuses, you will use a complex filter with
an array of the statuses you want. 


You can pass multiple simple filters. If you want all orders in
processing status that were created_at noon on December 10, 2013, you
would pass the code below. 


```ruby
api.order_list(simple_filters: [{key: "status", value: "processing"},
{key: created_at, value: "12/10/2013 12:00" }])
```

NOTE: Any datetime field is probably better off using a complex_filter
with an operator, like
```ruby
{key: "created_at", operator: "from", value: "12/10/2013"}
```

###Complex Filters
Complex filters have <b>operators</b> (I've supplied a list of Magento
operators below that I'm not sure is comprehensive, but it's a starting
point.)


```ruby
api.order_list(complex_filters: [{key: "status", operator: "eq", value:
["processing", "completed"]}, {key: created_at, operator: "from", value:
"12/10/2013" }])
```


You CANNOT pass multiple filters for the same key. The example below
will NOT work unfortunately. For example, if you are attempting to get
orders created between November 21, 2013 and January 31, 2014, you
cannot pass the code below, only the first filter will be acknowledged
by Magento:

```ruby
api.order_list(complex_filters: [{key: 'created_at', operator: "from",
value: "11/21/2013" }, {key: "created_at", operator: "to", value:
"1/31/2014"}])
```


###Magento Complex Filter Operators
Magento filters: from http://bit.ly/N6dRD4
The following is a list of valid complex_filter filter keys for Magento
SOAP API v2. They are part of a complexObjectArray. This may not be a
comprehensive list.


-"from" returns rows that are after this value (datetime only)
-"to" returns rows that are before this value (datetime only)
-"eq" returns rows equal to this value
-"neq" returns rows not equal to this value
-"like" returns rows that match this value (with % as a wildcard)
-"nlike" returns rows that do not match this value (with % as a
wildcard)
-"in" rows where the value is in this array (pass an array in)
-"nin" returns rows where the value is not in this array (pass an array
in)
-"is" use interchangeably with eq
-"null" returns rows that are null
-"notnull" returns rows that are not null
-"gt" returns rows greater than this value
-"lt" returns rows less than this value
-"gteq" returns rows greater than or equal to this value
-"lteq" returns rows less than or equal to this value
-"moreq" unsure
-"finset" unsure


###Magento Standard Statuses
Valid, standard order statuses for Magento SOAP API v2:
-'pending'
-'pending_payment'
-'processing'
-'holded'
-'complete'
-'closed'
-'canceled'
-'fraud'


NOTE: Magento also allows custom statuses, so to get all orders DO NOT
pass status_array. You will have to iterate through returned orders to
discover list of custom statuses for individual installations of
Magento.


###Notes on datetime fields
If you are filtering on a datetime field, you can pass a valid timestamp
in any format and it will be parsed and formatted correctly. The
required format for timestamps in Magento is:

```ruby
Time.parse(timestamp).strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
-or-
Time.now.to_formatted_s(:db)
```
